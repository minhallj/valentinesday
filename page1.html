 <p>The day we started talking, I had no idea that I would fall for you this hard. However, as time progressed, 
    I can't keep denying my feeling for you.
    Our time together has been so amazing and I hope every single day I can wake up with you in my life.
    The way you smile, the way you laugh, the way you inspire me to do better.
    I am so sure there is no better match for me in this world except you. 
    I promise that being with me, I'll do whatever it takes for you to be happy. I love you. And I hope you love me too. So,</p>
